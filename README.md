# TypeScript Type Mismatch Bug

This repository demonstrates a common type mismatch error in TypeScript and its solution.

The `bug.ts` file contains code that attempts to add a number and a string, resulting in a type error. The `bugSolution.ts` file shows how to fix this issue by explicitly type checking or using type assertion.
